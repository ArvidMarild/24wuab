            American artist Dana Schutz (b. 1976) is one of the great figurative
            painters of our time: an eminent storyteller who depicts people -
            and our relationships - in complex and often gigantic compositions.
            Her universe is disturbing and fascinating and makes us want to
            scream, laugh and cry at the same time.

            This exhibition invites you to explore the world of Edvard Munch
            —his ideas, processes, and the profoundly human topics that occupied
            him and that still affect us today. Through a wide selection from
            the museum’s collection, you can experience the richness of Munch’s
            artistic career and his unrelenting drive to experiment and
            innovate. The exhibition provides the opportunity to engage with
            themes and motifs that Munch explored his whole life in the form of
            paintings, graphics, drawing, photography, and sculpture—the tales
            of anxiety, death, love, and loneliness, which we all have in
            common.

            The Gothenburg Colourists were a group of Swedish artists active in
            the early 20th century, primarily during the first three decades.
            Influenced by the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists,
            particularly Paul Cézanne, as well as the Neo-Impressionists, the
            Gothenburg Colourists developed a unique style characterized by
            vibrant color palettes and bold brushwork. The group included
            prominent artists such as Nils Kreuger, Ragnar Sandberg, and Ivan
            Aguéli, among others.
