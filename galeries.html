            "Face Eater" by Dana Schutz is a provocative and enigmatic painting
            that confronts viewers with its unsettling imagery. In this work,
            Schutz employs bold colors and dynamic brushwork to depict a figure
            devouring its own face. The composition is both chaotic and
            mesmerizing, drawing the viewer into a realm where the boundaries
            between the real and the surreal blur. Through "Face Eater," Schutz
            explores themes of identity, consumption, and the complexity of the
            human psyche, inviting viewers to contemplate the darker aspects of
            existence.

            This exhibition invites you to explore the world of Edvard Munch
            —his ideas, processes, and the profoundly human topics that occupied
            him and that still affect us today. Through a wide selection from
            the museum’s collection, you can experience the richness of Munch’s
            artistic career and his unrelenting drive to experiment and
            innovate. The exhibition provides the opportunity to engage with
            themes and motifs that Munch explored his whole life in the form of
            paintings, graphics, drawing, photography, and sculpture—the tales
            of anxiety, death, love, and loneliness, which we all have in
            common.

            The Gothenburg Colourists were a group of Swedish artists active in
            the early 20th century, primarily during the first three decades.
            Influenced by the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists,
            particularly Paul Cézanne, as well as the Neo-Impressionists, the
            Gothenburg Colourists developed a unique style characterized by
            vibrant color palettes and bold brushwork. The group included
            prominent artists such as Nils Kreuger, Ragnar Sandberg, and Ivan
            Aguéli, among others.
